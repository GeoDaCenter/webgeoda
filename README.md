## About Webgeoda Scaffolding

**What is this thing?**

WebGeoDa is a set of tools, templates, and scaffolding to quickly and easily develop geospatial data dashboards. WebGeoDa builds on the GeoDa suite of geospatial software and extends jsGeoDa through accessible and ready-to-go examples.
WebGeoDa capabilities have four areas of complexity. It's easy to learn, but with a high ceiling for customization:

‚Äçüíª Add your geospatial data (GeoJSON), join it to your tabular data (CSV) right in the browser. Specify your variables with a simple JSON specification, and your map is ready to be published!

üìë Customize and add static pages to describe your data and the context of your dashboard. WebGeoDa provides some built-in styling tools using Plain CSS and a reasonably approachable JSX, similar to HTML.

üó∫ Add additional map features using Mapbox and Deck.gl, or explore additional data insights through interactive tooltip and sidebar functions.

ü¶∫ Dive directly into the WebGeoDa scaffolding with full control over custom react hooks, the jsGeoDa WebAssembly + WebWorker geospatial engine, a fast Redux-backed state, and extensible and accessible components. 

## What can WebGeoDa do?

WebGeoDa focuses on enabling exploratory data dashboards with complex data, the need for diverse variables, and high performance in-browser analytics. You can make maps with a variety of color-binning techniques and spatial statistical methods, like Hotspot cluster analysis, through a simple JSON based data and variable configuration.
